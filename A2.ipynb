A preferred embodiment of the interface includes an input buffer communicating with the program to receive text from the program. An input buffer pointer is provided for addressing the text in the input buffer. The input buffer pointer is passed to the text checking engine, which preferably is part of the API. The text checking engine performs a text checking function requested by the program and provides information responsive to the requested function. A return buffer communicates with the text checking engine to receive the responsive information from the engine. The return buffer also communicates with the program to allow the program to retrieve the responsive information from the return buffer. Preferably, a clean bit is attached to each section of text checked if no errors are found in the section of text by the engine. \n",

      "Text: System and method for text searching using an n-ary search tree  A system and method for searching a text file for the occurrence of user-selected text portions that satisfy user-specified conditions. The user-specified conditions are in the form of logical operator terms that interrelate user-selected word terms. The system uses a full text index describing the location of all word terms within a text file. The system accepts the user-selected word terms and the user-specified conditions and constructs an n-ary search tree where terminal nodes represent the user-selected text portions and the non-terminal nodes represent logical operator terms that interrelate the word terms. The system uses the full text index to construct index lists for each of the word terms and has an index pointer for each of the index lists. A Boolean evaluator analyzes each of the non-terminal nodes to determine if word terms represented by adjacent terminal nodes satisfies the logical operation term represented by the non-terminal nodes. The system determines which of the index pointers will be incremented by analyzing the location within the text file of the current occurrences of the words represented by terminal nodes and the next occurrences within the text file of the words represented by terminal nodes. Positive results of the non-terminal node analysis are temporarily saved and passed up the tree to the adjacent non-terminal node. When analysis of a non-terminal node is complete, the system will discard any index lists that have already been used in the completed non-terminal node analysis. The system and method require only a single pass through the full text index and do not require the use of intermediate files as are typical of a binary search tree. The system is easily implemented on a microcomputer with limited memory. \n",

      "Text: Method for handling different code pages in text  A method and word processing system for handling text pasted into a document that uses a foreign character set or code page. The code page used by text pasted into a document is preserved when that is displayed and edited. The word processing system keeps track of the appropriate code page for each run of text in the document using a piece table and a data block for the file(s) in which each piece of text is stored. Each document that is created has a piece table that includes an array of character positions and a corresponding array of data records. Each piece referenced in the array of character positions includes adjacent characters of text that are stored in a common file. When a file is opened to paste text into the document, the word processing system creates a file control block for that file, which includes a default code page identifier. The array of data records for each piece includes a pointer to the file control block. For any run of text that uses a code page different than the default for the file, an exception block is created. By referencing the default code page and any exception block, the word processing system determines the appropriate code page to be applied when text is displayed and edited. Foreign code page characters are translated into the native code page characters in the display buffer, but references to the foreign code pages are preserved when the document is stored, so that the characters encoded using the foreign code page are not lost or changed in the document. \n",

A computer system (10) that is generally conventional in design executes a word processing program that efficiently handles text pasted into a word processing document, even though that text uses a paragraph delimiter different than the native paragraph delimiter of the word processing system. The document opened by the word processing system has a corresponding piece table that includes an array of character positions and an array of data records. Each piece of the piece table represents adjacent characters that stored together in a file, and each record or PCD in the array of data records corresponds to a different piece in the piece table. When a file is opened to select text that will be pasted into the word processing document, a corresponding entry is made in the piece table that includes pointers to a file control block (FCB) for the opened file. The FCB indicates the type of paragraph delimiter used for that text. Thus, the word processing system tracks the appropriate paragraph delimiter used and translates any foreign paragraph delimiter to the native delimiter when displaying the text for editing. When the document is saved to a file, the paragraph delimiter associated with the text is translated to the native paragraph delimiter used by the word processing system. \n",

      "Text: Method and system for compressing video data  A method for compressing video movie data to a specified target size using intraframe and interframe compression schemes. In intraframe compression, a frame of the movie is compressed by comparing adjacent pixels within the same frame. In contrast, interframe compression compresses by comparing similarly situated pixels of adjacent frames. The method begins by compressing the first frame of the video movie using intraframe compression. The first stage of the intraframe compression process does not degrade the quality of the original data, e.g., the method uses run length encoding based on the pixels' color values to compress the video data. However, in circumstances where lossless compression is not sufficient, the method utilizes a threshold value, or tolerance, to achieve further compression. In these cases, if the color variance between pixels is less than or equal to the tolerance, the method will encode the two pixels using a single color value--otherwise, the method will encode the two pixels using different color values. The method increases or decreases the tolerance to achieve compression within the target range. In cases where compression within the target range results in an image of unacceptable quality, the method will split the raw data in half and compress each portion of data separately. Frames after the first frame are generally compressed using a combination of intraframe and interframe compression. Additionally, the method periodically encodes frames using intraframe compression only in order to enhance random frame access. \n",

      "Text: Visual display system having low energy data storage subsystem with date compression capabilities, and method for operating same  A visual display system for use in computers includes a frame buffer for holding visual information data in a particular format for ready input to a visual display device. The system also includes a compressed frame buffer for storing the visual information data in a compressed format which can be rapidly decompressed in real-time and used in the visual display device. The data is compressed by a microprocessor during idle times and decompressed by a decompression circuit on the fly. In some circumstances, the power consumed by compressing and then repeatedly handling the compressed data is less than the power used to repeatedly handle the full uncompressed data set. The visual display system analyzes the visual information data and determines whether compression would help save energy. In the event that the handling of compressed data saves energy, the visual display system will use the compressed data set until the information is changed or updated. In this manner, the visual display system reduces power consumption which helps improve battery life in portable computers. A method for operating a visual display system using this energy saving compression technique is also described. \n",

      "Text: Data compression for network transport  Disclosed is a method and system for data compression. In a preferred embodiment, an input stream of data bytes are compressed into an encoded stream using an LZ77-based scheme. The preferred method searches for a matching sequence of already processed data bytes that is identical to a current sequence of bytes. Sequences of literals (bytes not forming part of a matching sequence) or match codes (encoded matching sequences) are identified by count values indicating the number of literals or match codes in the sequence. Preferably, the encoded stream is transmitted from a first computer to a second computer, where the encoded stream is decompressed. The method uses matching circular history buffers for compression and decompression, the history buffers being synchronized using a coherency byte included with each frame of encoded data transmitted. If an encoded frame is not received by the decompression device, the decompression device transmits a flush request to the compression device. The compression device flushes its history buffer in response to the flush request, the flushing step making the previously processed bytes stored in the history buffer incapable of becoming part of a matching sequence. The compression device includes in the coherency code of the next encoded frame a control code indicating whether a flush request has been received by the compression device. \n",

The system divides the bit-map data into one or more chaingons, which are a series of pixels that are contiguous in either the horizontal direction, the vertical direction, or diagonally. Each chaingon is defined by its starting location in the bit-map, and its length. Each chaingon is encoded separately using delta encoding with respect to the starting location of the chaingon. The delta encoding uses variable length data codes where the most common delta values are assigned the fewer data bits and the less common delta values are assigned more data bits. The delta encoded chaingons may be compressed to save additional storage space. The system may be readily used in any computer system where bit-map data files are stored or transmitted to a second computer. The invention is particularly useful in printers or facsimile machines where character fonts are transmitted along with text data.

The method and system also includes a decompressor for decompressing the compressed stream into a decompressed stream of data bytes that is identical to the input stream. The compression system encodes matches using token offsets rather than the byte offsets used by prior art LZ77-based compression schemes. The compression system uses knowledge of the internal format of the input stream to identify tokens that are used to determine the token offsets. Preferably, the method parses the input stream by dividing it into tokens and assigning a token type to each token. The method searches the input stream for a matching sequence of already processed tokens that is identical to a current sequence of tokens. If a matching sequence is found, the method determines whether the token type of a selected token, such as the first token, of the current sequence matches the token type of a corresponding token of the matching sequence.

The multiple bytes are transmitted from the host computer to the peripheral, each transmitted byte containing a data clock and several bits of peripheral data. In one embodiment, the peripheral data byte is apportioned into two bytes within the host computer with each byte having a pair of clock signals transmitted along with the peripheral data portion. In another embodiment, three bytes of peripheral data are apportioned into four bytes within the host computer with each byte having a single clock signal transmitted along with the peripheral data portion. Within the peripheral, a clock circuit detects the clock signal from each transmitted byte and generates a delayed signal to latch peripheral data bytes into a storage register. In addition, the first transmitted byte contains a flag to signal the peripheral that the data that follows is RLE compressed data. Parity bits are also included in the transmitted data. The system can be easily implemented on any Centronics compatible printer system to increase the rate of data transfer. \n",

A results analyzer checks test parameters following the execution of each of a series of predetermined test commands and a series of random test commands to determine if the commands were properly executed. The test command sequences and test results determined by the results analyzer are stored in a log file which may be examined by the tester. The randomly selected test command sequence is stored in a tracker log file. The tester may reexecute the tracker file in its entirety or any portion selected by the tester as a means of determining the cause of an error in the software. The system also provides for error recovery. When an error is detected, the system restarts the test of the computer software and continues maintaining the log file and the tracker file. The system also uses the probabilities for various responses that an end-user may make in response to a particular screen display or program state. The system may select random responses corresponding to the probabilities. These probabilities are calculated for each individual screen display or software state.

The line number in the program reached after executing the debug command is also stored on the tape. The debug history tape is a sequential record of the debug commands. A user may reexecute one or more of the debug commands on the program by running the debug history tape. The user may stop the reexecution of the debug commands on a given line in the program generally in the area thought to contain the error, by moving an ending pointer to that region in the debug history tape. The tape will execute up to the ending pointer and then stop. The user may then examine the program, execute additional debug commands or take other action to locate the error. Any additional debug commands are also stored on the tape. The ability to reexecute the debug commands and stopping their execution at selected lines in the program aids the user in locating errors. After locating the errors, the user modifies the program. The user may then reexecute the same debug commands on the modified program to ensure that the error has been corrected. \n",

      "Text: Method and system for dynamic-link library  A dynamic-link library method and system for providing services to one or more application programs. The system includes a code resource that includes a plurality of service routines to allow any of the programs to use the service routines. The code resource is physically distinct from the application programs and does not have to be copied into the application programs, which allow the code resource and the application programs to be updated, compiled, and tested separately from each other. A selector routine receives the selection information from the stub routine, and in response thereto accesses the associated service routine and causes the associated service routine to perform its intended service. Preferably, the stub routine allocates parameters to be used by the associated service routine and passes the parameters to the selector routine along with the selection information. Preferably an interface routine is used to translate an index to the code resource into a selector pointer to the selector routine. The interface routine receives the selection information from the stub routine and passes the selection information to the selector routine using the selector pointer. A resource initiation routine loads and locks the code resource into memory. The resource initiation routine allocates resource global variables space for storing resource global variables used by the code resource. The selector routine saves an index to program global variables space for storing program global variables, the index being previously stored in a register. The selector routine stores an index to the resource global variables space into the register. After a service routine performs its service the selector routine restores the index to the program global variables space into the register. When the services of the code resource are no longer needed the current main program calls a resource termination routine. The resource termination routine unlocks the code resource in and disposes of the index to the resource global variables space. \n",

In preferred embodiments on an Intel 80386 processor, an application program and operating system kernel share a code segment address space and a data segment address space from 0 to 4G. During the execution of the application program, which executes in user mode, a page table is defined to prevent the application program from accessing pages which correspond to the address space of 2G to 4G. When the application program invokes a system routine, the system routine does not need to load the data segment register since the application program and the kernel share the same data segment. If an application program does load the data segment register with a selector other than the selector for the shared data segment, then when the kernel tries to access memory using the data segment register, an exception is generated. The exception handler restores the selector for the shared data segment into the data segment register and resumes execution of the instruction which caused the exception. \n",

      "Text: Luminance emphasized color image rendering  A high color resolution image is rendered using a palette having a lower color resolution. The color of each pixel in the image is mapped to the nearest of the palette colors located on or between levels of uniform luminance adjacent to the pixel color. The mapping of the pixel color is further constrained to exclude palette colors for which double the error to the pixel color is outside the color gamut. The mapping is performed efficiently by a look-up table, the size of which is reduced by first dithering the pixel color to a color in an intermediate palette and then indexing the table using the intermediate palette color to find the reduced palette color. The mapping can be performed in an error diffusion process in which the pixel's color is modified by error diffused from any previously rendered neighboring pixels, then mapped to a reduced palette color to render the pixel with the reduced palette color, and finally diffuse any error between the pixel's color and the reduced palette color to any not yet rendered pixels. \n",

An indicator such as a bit string is loaded into one location of a register and the group of source bits is loaded into another location in the register. The contents of the register are then rotated to move successive portions of the group into a register location where the portions can be accessed for a process. Tracking the processing of the successive portions of the bit group is handled efficiently in a loop through monitoring of the indicator, which \"walks\" through the register concurrently with movement of the successive portions of the source bit group. When the indicator bit has returned to its initial register location, the processing of the group of source bits is complete.

Upon the occurrence of a logical event in an operating program, an alert report is generated and stored in a buffer. An alert function call occurs, providing the event type and a pointer to the buffer. The alert function call reads a look-up table listing the programs or users requesting notification of events. The look-up table provides the addresses to which notification should be sent and the type of notification requested. The alert subroutine sends the requested event data from the buffer to the listed addresses. The alert function is completed and the operating program resumes operation. Upon receiving the event report, the receiving program stores it, displays it to a user, generates additional reports, begins controlling network activities, or the like as directed by the receiving program. The invention provides the advantage that each operating program need only perform a universal function call to send event data through the network and then may return to a task. The operating program is not concerned with who receives the report or what action is taken based on the report.

A system and method for analyzing the execution times for draw primitives allows the host computer to determine whether the printer will be able to render draw primitives in real-time. If the printer cannot render the draw primitives in real-time, the host computer may send the draw primitives to be pre-rendered by the printer.

If the printer exceeds the determined execution time, the host computer generate a timeout error message. No false timeout error messages are generated by the host computer because the timeout period is related to the actual processing time required by the printer. If the printer is coupled to a network, the timeout period may be set to the maximum thirty second period because the host computer may not have continuous communication with the printer. The host computer will still not generate false timeout errors because the maximum timeout period is still related to the actual processing time required by the printer.

When a read request is issued to the CD-ROM drive, a seek is immediately initiated. A timer, with a period much shorter than the typical seek time of a CD-ROM drive, is started and any requests to the peripheral hard disk drive are initiated. When the timer times out and when the hard disk request is complete, an inquiry is made to determine whether the CD-ROM drive has finished seeking. This inquiry is accomplished by determining the status of a bit set by the CD-ROM drive in a register in the computer when the CD-ROM drive has finished seeking. If the bit is set, indicating the CD-ROM seek is complete, the data transfer request is immediately issued to the CD-ROM drive. If the bit is not set, indicating the CD-ROM seek is not complete, the timer is reset and the service of hard disk drive requests continues. \n",

The user draws lines on the display screen, with the lines being aligned with marks on rulers which are also displayed along each axis of the display screen. The ruler marks are labeled in units, such as millimeters, which are often impossible to accurately display on the computer screen. The system then converts the coordinates to a high resolution coordinate system value that corresponds to the position and size of the object in relation to the labeled marks on the ruler. When the display screen is printed, the object is printed in accordance with the labels on the rulers rather than the displayed image of the object on the computer screen. Similarly, the high resolution value for the intended length of the object is used to display the image on the screen relative to the ruler when the object is moved about on the screen. The method may be easily implemented on a computer using graphics or desktop publishing software. \n",

This permits programs designed to be used with operating systems that do not apply a rigorous object ownership model to be used with an operating system capable of applying a rigorous object ownership model. The method and system has both an automatic object deallocation phase and an object access control phase. In the automatic deallocation control phase, the method and system defers the automatic deallocation of objects owned by programs that are incompatible with automatic object deallocation until a later time at which no such programs are still running. Instead of immediately deallocating the objects owned by a terminating program, the method and system designates them for deferred deallocation. At a later time, the method and system checks to see whether any programs that are incompatible with automatic object deallocation are still running, and, if none are, the method and system deallocates all objects designated for deferred deallocation. In the object access control phase, the method and system allows special permissive access to objects owned by programs that are unable to authorize access to the object by other programs.

Each pixel of the color image is represented by an active color vector, which typically, but not necessarily, is an RGB (red, green, blue) triplet. Often, the display device cannot display the exact color vector desired, so it displays the closest active color to the desired color, thereby resulting in an error vector for each pixel. The method computes the error vector by vector subtracting a color vector representing the active color displayed from the color vector of the desired color. The computed error vector is diffused to adjacent pixels by adjusting the color vectors of the adjacent pixels by fractions of the computed error value. Preferably, the method characterizes each color that can be displayed on the display device by measuring the color directly using a colorimeter which eliminates errors caused by non-linear combinations of the color coordinates of the color vectors. Preferably, the method also adjusts the desired color vector for each pixel to compensate for color bleeding between pixels. \n",
