Solution: Text Answers are in the [Textual Answers.docx](https://github.com/anahita-13/Textual-similarity-analysis/blob/main/Textual%20Answers.docx) file and solution code is in the [A2.py](https://github.com/anahita-13/Textual-similarity-analysis/blob/main/A2.py) file. The [A2.ipynb](https://github.com/anahita-13/Textual-similarity-analysis/blob/main/A2.ipynb) file is the Jupyter notebook associated with the solution code and its execution line by line. [A2.pdf](https://github.com/anahita-13/Textual-similarity-analysis/blob/main/A2.pdf) is the pdf version of the same. 

The pairwise cosine similarity has been calculated and dumped in the csv file named [Cosine_similarity_scores.csv](https://github.com/anahita-13/Textual-similarity-analysis/blob/main/Cosine_similarity_scores.csv)
